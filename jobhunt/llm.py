"""Two-stage LLM layer: cheap screen over everything, rich draft for the top few.

Cost lives here, so the two stages are deliberately lopsided:

  screen  batch ~8 jobs per call, JD truncated to ~1400 chars, cheapest model
  draft   one call per job, ~6000 chars of JD, best model, only for the top ~5

Both stages take an optional (provider, model) pair so tests can inject a stub
and so you can point screening at Groq while drafting stays on Claude.
